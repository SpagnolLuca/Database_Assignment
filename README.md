# Database_Assignment

I created an enviroment using the python -m venv env command, where then i used env\Scripts\activate command to activate it.

I then used pip install fastapi uvicorn motor pydantic python-dotenv requests to download all the neccesary dependencies on to  VS code.

after i installed everything, i used pip freeze > requirments.txt to generate a file that lists all the packages with their versions.

after putting the code into a main.py file, running it using the link works.

A mongoDB Cluster was created and connected using mongo Compass, I then created fake data using JSON files which appear on both Compass and Atlas.
